# 👋 Hi there, Irene here!

🛩️ I am a Master of Aviation student from [Swinburne University](https://swinburne.edu.au).\
🚗 I do smart home, automotive, and computer related stuff on the side for fun.\
🪪 I also maintain a fork of openpilot for Toyota/Lexus vehicles. [Give it a try.](https://github.com/cydia2020/dodgypilot)
